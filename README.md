# org.jivesoftware-whack
Maven version of Whack library (http://www.igniterealtime.org/builds/whack/)

---

### From the original documentation

> Whack is a Java library that easily allows the creation of external components that follow the XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol.
>
> Components that were implemented as internal components of Openfire but do not make use of the internal API of Openfire could be ported to Whack and run as external components.
>
> _Whack started to be implemented on November 2004 and is currently being used by Jive. The library was always available from SVN and many people are using it. However, it was never released as a public library until July 2008._
